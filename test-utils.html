  <p class="text">" Immodest words admit of no defense, For want of modesty is want of sense." Now, is not want of sense (where a man is so unfortunate as to want it) some apology for his want of modesty? and would not the lines stand more justly thus? " Immodest words admit but this defense, That want of modesty is want of sense." This, however, I should submit to better judg- ments. My brother had, in 1720 or 1721, begun to print a newspaper. It was the second that appeared in America,^ and was called the New England Courant. The only one before it was the Boston News-Letter. I remember his be- ing dissuaded by some of his friends from the undertaking, as not likely to succeed, one news- paper being, in their judgment, enough for America. At this time (1771) there are not less than five-and-twenty. He went on, however, with the undertaking, and after having worked in composing the types and printing off the 1 Franklin's memory does not serve him correctly here. The Courant was really the fifth newspaper established in America, although generally called the fourth, because the first, Public Oc- currences, published in Boston in 1690, was suppressed after the first issue. Following is the order in which the other four papers were published: Boston News Letter, 1704; Boston Ga- zette, December 21, 1719; The American Weekly Mercury, Phila- delphia, December 22, 1719; The New England Courant, 1721.</p>
